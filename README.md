# Flutter macOS GUI

This project, Flutter Cupertino Desktop (CK), defines Flutter widgets for Desktop, providing a macOS-style aesthetic, built upon the foundation of Cupertino widgets.

The goal is to be able to develop applications for all desktop systems, including the web, filling in the gaps in the Cupertino theme.

The CK prefix strives to be distinctive within the Flutter ecosystem, while remaining concise and suggestive of Flutter Desktop and macOS AppKit. In doing so, it captures the essence of the project.

## Getting Started

The project itself is just a set of libraries that define and manage widgets. However, it includes an example of how to use them. The example can be seen on this website:

To run the example in a local application:

cd example
flutter create .
flutter run
