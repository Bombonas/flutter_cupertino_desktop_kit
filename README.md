# Flutter macOS GUI

This project, Flutter Cupertino Desktop (CX), defines Flutter widgets for Desktop, providing a macOS-style aesthetic, built upon the foundation of Cupertino widgets.

The goal is to be able to develop applications for all desktop systems, including the web, filling in the gaps in the Cupertino theme.

The CX prefix aims to be unique within the Flutter ecosystem, while also being concise and evocative of ideas of graphics, experience, and expansion. In doing so, it embodies the spirit of the project.

## Getting Started

The project itself is just a set of libraries that define and manage widgets. However, it includes an example of how to use them. The example can be seen on this website:

To run the example in a local application:

cd example
flutter create .
flutter run
