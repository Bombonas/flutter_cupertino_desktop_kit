# Flutter macOS GUI

This project defines Flutter Widgets for Desktop, with a macOS-style aesthetic, using Cupertino as a foundation.

The goal is to be able to develop applications for all desktop systems, including the web, filling in the gaps in the Cupertino theme.

## Getting Started

The project itself is just a set of libraries that define and manage widgets. However, it includes an example of how to use them. The example can be seen on this website:

To run the example in a local application:

cd example
flutter create .
flutter run
